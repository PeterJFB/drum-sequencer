# Drum sequencer release 2

## Changes in git workflow

Moving into the second release, we decided to make it easer to se the the stable versions of our application. We were inspired by the [gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), an expansion of the trunk-based developement which separates features, releases and developement into separate branches. This transition was easy to make, as we already were familiar and used a lot of the branching methods described in this document. The following branches were used:

- [main branch](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2021/gr2101/gr2101/) contains the latest release, and is only updated by the latter branch. This branch was previously named master. Both are well-recognized standards, and we chose main as it was a simple change, yet significant in regards to the latest shift.
- [develop branch](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2021/gr2101/gr2101/-/tree/develop) contains the non-released features. All features will be branched from and merged with this branch.

Below is a graph from [bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) showing an example of our workflow:

## Code quality

### Checkstyle

[Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) was implemented to ensure equal readability throughout the java-project.
The current implementation is checking with the format described in the [google style guide](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/styleguides/google-java-style-20180523/javaguide.html), though the styleguide may be adjusted later to better suit our project.

### Jacoco

[Jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) allowed us to see a detailed schema of current test coverage, and has proven uselful to show where to write more tests.
