## Spring Boot as a web service

We previously mentioned accessing storage through a REST-api. This has been achieved with [Spring](https://spring.io/), a popular [IoC](https://www.baeldung.com/inversion-control-and-dependency-injection-in-spring)-based framework to create such services.

The framework itself uses similar programming concepts as [Jakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_RESTful_Web_Services), i.e. creating independent services which can be injected and managed by a main application. Spring itself is packaged in an additional layer of logic to run the project as a web service, called [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). This has allowed us to focus on writing the REST-logic of our application, while [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) and other dependecies are configured to the expected standards. Spring boot also supports strong REST-enforcement with their preconfigured controllers, adding and additional layer of code quality checks when writing the application.
